Possible Designs:

1) Script + Sheets
	This design would be a script (or two) that pulls down info from a Google Sheets document, makes a selection, and writes the result back.

	Pros:
	-No hosting required
	-Quick to develop
	-No need to write a UI

	Cons:
	-Reliant on users keeping the Sheets formatted correctly, etc.
	-Less freedom to add complex features (example: no natural way to do voting or automatically enforce time limits on the vote)
	-Must be run manually each month

2) Full web app
	This design would be a web app, possibly built from scratch, possibly on an existing framework, that handles all aspects of the book selection problem.

	Pros:
	-Complete freedom to add complex features
	-Input validation

	Cons:
	-Requires hosting
	-Longer to develop
