Book Club Manager System Test Cases

    These tests should be run after all the Google API credentials and the config file have been set up. The service account should have no files owned by it or shared with it, except the default welcome document provided by Google if applicable. The book club manager also creates some local files specified in the config file which should be removed prior to rerunning all tests. Many of these tests depend on tests earlier in the order, so it is recommended that the tests be ran in order.
